## Requirements
* The app should display the sum of 2 given numbers
* The app should be able to add negative numbers
* The app should be able to add decimals
* The app should report invalid input
* The app should be accessible to users

## Build Requirements
* Functionality should be tested with unit tests
* The requirements should be tested with acceptence tests
* Tests should be run automatically by the build
* Deployment should be run automatically.

## Development Environment
* Open a console in the root folder (calc) and run
  $npm test (or shortcut npm t) to run automated unit tests. It will run the command specified in the "scripts" object in the project.json file.
* Some tests are still manual (need to be ported). To run these run calc/test/index.html using live server and check the devtools console.
